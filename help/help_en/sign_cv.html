    <B>CV designation system</B>
    <BR>
    <BR>
    For example: CV4004
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Base format is 'Cvxxxx', where xxxx is an 4 digits number as type code.
    This designation has used by the British Military to codify vacuum tubes, gas tubes, and
    latterly, some semiconductor devices.
    <BR>
    CV numbers can be directly mapped onto NATO numbers, as 5960-XX-000-YYYY where XX is the
     country code, and YYYY is the CV number. For example, 5960-99-000-4004=CV4004 (12AX7WA),
    with 99 indicating country of origin as UK.<BR>
